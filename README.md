# feature_generating_graphs
FGG is a read-write object graph framework for data virtualization, dynamic read-writes, traversals and feature computations

## FGG is a structured graph 
	- Node is the prototype for objects (conversely objects are instances of node) 
	- Edges are defined by set of nodes are prototypes for relationships.
	- Similar to objects the term link refers to single instance of relationship (or an Edge)
	- Edges for more than 2 nodes are possible and create what are called as Hypergraphs

Attributes can be added to both nodes and edges and are implicitly timeseries and not scalar values  

## 
FGG requires a language specific client library that abstracts the low level connectivity details of gRPC.  
This section describes how to use the client API to interact with the graph

# Synchronization

Synchronization is one of the biggest features of StackEdit. It enables you to synchronize any file in your workspace with other files stored in your **Google Drive**, your **Dropbox** and your **GitHub** accounts. This allows you to keep writing on other devices, collaborate with people you share the file with, integrate easily into your workflow... The synchronization mechanism takes place every minute in the background, downloading, merging, and uploading file modifications.

There are two types of synchronization and they can complement each other:

- The workspace synchronization will sync all your files, folders and settings automatically. This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.
	> To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.

- The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub**.
	> Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the **Synchronize** sub-menu.


## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|
